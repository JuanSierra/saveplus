## saveplus
The left way to REALLY backup some of your google plus history. ** This script extracts data to a JSON and generate an HTML **

![sample](https://github.com/JuanSierra/saveplus/blob/master/assets/saveplus.gif)

## why?
Google decided to kill again one more of his products and all your content is going to pass to the history. Give it a graceful grave âœ¿ðŸ’€âœ¿

## how to use it

```
npm install
```

Create a .env (or dot.env) file with the following structure

```
GOOGLE_USER="user@gmail.com"
GOOGLE_PWD=password
```

```
npm start
```

## what is happening
From google plus settings > setting log is possible to know what post you did a +1 !
This script extracts all the +1 posts and then get the content to export it as a handly json file
Alternatively (WIP) you can have a complete html with all your favorite posts and a search tool. Self Contained
